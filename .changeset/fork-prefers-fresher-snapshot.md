`forkThread` now overlays the in-memory snapshot on top of the persisted row when the snapshot is fresher (more messages) than what's in SQL. Previously, once any version of the source row existed in the database, the snapshot was ignored — so forks could lose the latest unflushed user message, which is exactly the scenario chat-fork-from-unflushed is meant to fix. Guarded with `snapshot.messageCount > stored.messageCount` so a stale snapshot from another tab can't clobber a fresher persisted row.
